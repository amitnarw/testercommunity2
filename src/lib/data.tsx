        question: "What can I use points for?",
        answer: "Points are the currency of inTesters. You use them to 'pay' community members for testing your app. The more points you offer for your project, the more attractive it is to testers, and the faster you'll likely receive feedback."
    },
    {
        question: "Do my purchased points expire?",
        answer: "No, your points never expire. You can use them whenever you're ready to start a new testing cycle for your app."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between earning and buying points?",
        answer: "Earning points is freeâ€”you contribute your time and skill by testing other apps. Buying points is a shortcut that lets you fund your projects immediately without having to test other apps first. It's perfect for when you're on a tight deadline."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I get a refund on purchased points?",
        answer: "Points that have not been spent on a testing project are eligible for a refund within 14 days of purchase. Please contact our support team for assistance."
